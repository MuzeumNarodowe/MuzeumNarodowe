      <p style="font-size: 20px;   background-color: rgba(233, 226, 226, 0.4);">"The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is an Expressionist painting created in 1893 by Norwegian artist 
        Edvard Munch. Many art critics consider The Scream to be Munch's greatest work. They believe the painting depicts a contemporary person pierced by existential pain. 
        The background landscape shows a fjord near Oslo, visible from Ekeberg Hill. The painting was also given the title Cry.
  
        The Scream, along with such paintings as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers, is one of the most famous images in the world. 
        It is considered a masterpiece of Expressionism."</p>

            "Madonna from Krużlowa - a Gothic sculpture depicting the Virgin Mary with the Baby Jesus. 
            It was created around 1410. The name of the work comes from the village of Krużlowa Wyżna in Lesser Poland, where the sculpture was located until 1899. 
            It was then purchased by the National Museum in Krakow, where it still is today. The author of the work is unknown. 
            Nothing is known about its provenance and exact date of creation (generally assumed to be the beginning of the 15th century). 
            It may not have been made as a cult figure, but rather served as the main decoration of the altar retable in one of Krakow's churches."</p>

        "Strange Garden" by Józef Mehoffer is a composition that goes far beyond the category of portraits of people closest to the artist. It was created during the summer vacation of the painter and his family in Siedlec near Cracow in 1902, but was finally completed in 1903, as the signature informs. Shown publicly over the next three years in Vienna, St. Louis, Chicago and Munich won the acclaim of jurors and official awards.
  
        The canvas depicts three people: the artist’s wife, his son and a nanny. The axis of the composition defines the diagonal formed by the path running deep into the garden. 
        The characters emerge from the orchard’s shaded alleyway shaded by apple trees and head towards the viewer, entering the sun-drenched open clearing. 
        The eye is attracted by the illuminated figure of a naked child, treading carefully on soft grass and holding in raised hands long stems of pink-red mallow, 
        which emphasize its role as a "guide" of the walk. The boy bathed in the sun radiates reflected light, intensifying his childlike charm and innocence. 
        The child is followed by the mother, dressed in an elegant sapphire dress and hat. Shown on the edge of the orchard, it is partly submerged in a deep shadow. 
        The lower parts of her dress are illuminated by the sharp sun, in which the folds of shimmering fabric shine. 
        With his head raised and slightly tilted, he looks towards the viewer, or rather his husband-painter. With his left hand he holds the plentiful folds of the dress, 
        with the right reaches towards a branch densely covered with fruit. In the background, deep in a shady alley, 
        there is a figure of a nanny of a child - dressed in the folk costume of Cracow and illuminated by single rays of sun falling through the crowns of trees.

    The Mona Lisa (Italian: Gioconda) is an oil painting painted on a poplar panel by Leonardo da Vinci, an Italian Renaissance artist. 
    Its name derives from the word mona, which in Tuscan dialect is an abbreviation for ma donna ("my lady") and the name of the alleged subject of the portrait, 
    It is known in Italian and Spanish as La Gioconda, and in French as La Joconde, from the family name of the merchant who ordered the work.[3]
  
    The painting was made between 1503 and 1507; It is now located in the Louvre, Paris, and remains the property of the French government. 
    The work was put on permanent exhibition at the Louvre in 1797. It is one of the most famous and appreciated paintings of the Renaissance period. 
    During its move to a temporary exhibition in Washington, D.C., in 1962, the painting was insured for $100 million, which testifies to its high value on the art market.
